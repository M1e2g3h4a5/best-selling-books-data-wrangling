Exploratory Data Analysis & Business Intelligence
Book Dataset Analysis (Task 2 – Internship Program)
📌 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a book dataset to uncover meaningful patterns, trends, and relationships. The analysis focuses on answering business-oriented questions using SQL and presenting insights through a structured Power BI dashboard mock-up.

📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains structured information about books, including:
Book Name
Author
Genre
Price
Rating
Reviews Count
Print Length
Publishing Year
Reading Age
The data was cleaned and prepared before performing analysis.

❓ Business Questions Addressed
Which genres generate the highest total reviews?
What is the average rating across different genres?
Is there a relationship between price and rating?
Do books with more reviews have higher ratings?
How has book publishing trended over time?
Does book length influence average rating?

🔍 Key Findings

Fiction & Action genres dominate in total review count.
Average ratings across most genres remain consistently high (above 4.4).
Price shows almost no correlation with rating.
Higher review count does not necessarily indicate higher rating.
Short books slightly outperform long books in terms of average rating.
Publishing activity has increased significantly in recent years.
